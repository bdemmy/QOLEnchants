# QOLEnchants
Quality of Life enchantments plugin for Fabric. Adds several enchantments that are just nice to have without being bloated like other solutions

- Inferno: Simple autosmelt enchantment. Integrated with fortune.
- Vein Mine: Pretty self explanatory. On ores, will vein mine 
  most/the entire vein. With trees it will destroy the entire 
  tree with one hit. Integrates well with inferno.
- Springheel: Boosted jump height. Can jump ~2 blocks high 
  instead of the vanilla jump height of 1.
- More to come
